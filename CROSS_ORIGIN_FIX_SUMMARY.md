# Cross-Origin Isolation Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement
When accessing the Godot platformer game on GitHub Pages (https://kabuumu.github.io/godot-platformer/), users encountered these errors:

```
Error
The following features required to run Godot projects on the Web are missing:
Cross Origin Isolation - Check web server configuration (send correct headers)
SharedArrayBuffer - Check web server configuration (send correct headers)
```

## Root Cause
Godot 4.2+ web exports require Cross-Origin Isolation to enable SharedArrayBuffer for threading support. This requires specific HTTP headers:
- `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp` (or `credentialless`)
- `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`
- `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: cross-origin`

GitHub Pages doesn't allow custom HTTP headers, making it impossible to serve these headers directly.

## Solution Implementation

### 1. COI Service Worker (web_template/coi-serviceworker.min.js)
- Implements a Service Worker that intercepts fetch requests
- Adds required Cross-Origin headers to all responses
- Handles both initial installation and updates
- Based on the proven coi-serviceworker library (v0.1.7)

### 2. Custom HTML Shell (web_template/index.html)
- Modified Godot HTML template that loads the COI Service Worker
- Includes user-friendly error messages with refresh instructions
- Properly initializes the Godot engine with all required configurations
- Maintains compatibility with Godot's template variable system

### 3. Export Configuration (export_presets.cfg)
- Updated `html/custom_html_shell` to point to the custom template
- Maintains all other Godot 4.2 web export settings

### 4. Build Pipeline (.github/workflows/build-deploy.yml)
- Added step to copy coi-serviceworker.min.js to deployment directory
- Ensures Service Worker is available in the published site

### 5. Documentation (web_template/README.md)
- Comprehensive guide explaining the fix
- Browser compatibility information
- First-time loading instructions

## Technical Details

### How the Service Worker Works:
1. User visits the game page
2. Custom HTML loads and registers the Service Worker
3. Page reloads to activate the Service Worker (first visit only)
4. Service Worker intercepts all fetch requests
5. Required headers are added to responses
6. Godot engine can now use SharedArrayBuffer and threading

### First-Time User Experience:
- Initial visit: Service Worker installs, page may need refresh
- Subsequent visits: Game loads immediately with headers already in place
- Error message includes instructions to refresh if needed
