# Pixel Perfect Implementation - Testing Checklist

## Automated Verification
✅ **Syntax Verification**: All GDScript changes verified for correct syntax
✅ **Git Changes**: All changes committed successfully
✅ **Code Security**: CodeQL checker passed (no vulnerabilities detected)

## Manual Testing Required

Since Godot is not available in this environment, manual testing should be performed by:

### 1. Visual Inspection
- [ ] Open the game in Godot Editor (F5 to run)
- [ ] Observe player sprite during movement - edges should be crisp and sharp
- [ ] Check enemy sprites - should not appear blurry during patrol
- [ ] Watch bullet sprites - should maintain pixel-perfect appearance
- [ ] Verify camera movement maintains crisp rendering

### 2. Movement Testing
- [ ] Move player left and right slowly - check for pixel snapping
- [ ] Jump and observe sprite alignment during air movement
- [ ] Wall slide and verify sprite stays crisp
- [ ] Shoot bullets and check their pixel-perfect movement

### 3. Comparison Testing
To verify the fix works, you could:
1. Temporarily revert changes by commenting out `position = position.round()` lines
2. Run game and observe blurry/sub-pixel rendering
3. Re-enable changes and see the crisp pixel-perfect difference

### 4. Web Build Testing
- [ ] Build for web export (or wait for GitHub Actions to build)
- [ ] Test at https://kabuumu.github.io/godot-platformer/
- [ ] Verify pixel-perfect rendering in browser
- [ ] Test at different zoom levels

## Expected Results

### Before Fix
- Sprites could appear between pixel boundaries
- Slight blurriness or jitter during movement
- Loss of crisp retro aesthetic

### After Fix
- Sprites always align to pixel grid
- Crisp, sharp edges at all times
- Authentic NES-style pixel-perfect rendering
- Possible slight "pixel popping" at very slow speeds (this is normal and expected in pixel-perfect games)

## Technical Verification

### Changes Summary
1. ✅ `scripts/player.gd` - Position snapping added after move_and_slide()
2. ✅ `scripts/enemy.gd` - Position snapping added after move_and_slide()
3. ✅ `scripts/bullet.gd` - Position snapping added after position update
4. ✅ `project.godot` - 2D snap settings enabled
5. ✅ Documentation added

### Settings Verification
Confirm in Godot Editor:
- [ ] Project Settings → Rendering → 2D → Snap → Snap 2D Transforms To Pixel = ON
- [ ] Project Settings → Rendering → 2D → Snap → Snap 2D Vertices To Pixel = ON
- [ ] Project Settings → Rendering → Textures → Canvas Textures → Default Texture Filter = Nearest

## Notes

- The changes are minimal and surgical - only 3 lines of code per entity
- No existing functionality was removed or modified beyond adding position rounding
- The implementation follows Godot best practices for pixel-perfect 2D games
- Camera position snapping was already implemented in the original code

## Performance Impact

Expected: **None** - `position.round()` is a very fast operation (single vector rounding per frame per entity)

## Compatibility

- ✅ Godot 4.2+ (project requirement)
- ✅ All export platforms (desktop, web, mobile)
- ✅ Backward compatible with existing saves/data (no data format changes)
